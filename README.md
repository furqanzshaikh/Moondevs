Task-Fragmentation
AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragmentation of Functinality / UI

My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that
## UI Fragmentation - README


Fragmenting UI into smaller components enhances development in several ways:

1.Dividing UI into smaller, focused parts improves code readability and understanding.

2.Components can be recycled across the app, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency.

3.Easy identification and modification of individual components streamline updates and bug fixes.

4.Smaller components facilitate targeted testing, ensuring robustness and reliability.

5.Flexible components enable swift adjustments to evolving requirements and design changes.

By embracing UI fragmentation, developers can build more manageable, scalable, and adaptable applications, fostering collaboration and efficiency in development efforts.
